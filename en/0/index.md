I like programming languages (PL) and to explain things I know. It is the first reason to decide to write articles about PL. However, to choose the topic of an article is not completely easy at the beginning. Various subjects exist in PL.

I think that writing reading materials for the *programming languages* course of KAIST can be a nice starting point. It gives me the motivation to keep writing articles rather than giving up on someday since many reviews of the course in [OTL](https://otl.kaist.ac.kr/review/result/course/749/2/) are claiming that the course is difficult to study due to the lack of supplementary materials. Lecture slides used in the course target materials for lectures with oral explanations but not for self-study. Besides, because PL is not as popular as some other fields like machine learning, online materials for undergraduate-level students are rare. Despite great lectures by professor Ryu, the reasons make many students feel difficulties to follow the content of the course when they are not able to understand the whole lectures. I hope that my articles can help students taking the course.

At the first place, I considered writing in only Korean since Korean articles treating PL topics can hardly be found while there are ones in English. However, to use the articles as the official reading materials of the course, writing in English as well as Korean is necessary. The course is given in English and students, who are more familiar with English than Korean, also takes the course. Therefore, I am planning to write both in Korean and English even though the decision makes the load become twice.

For fairness, I will try hard to include the same amount of technical detail in articles written in the respective languages. Korean versions might contain a larger number of kind sentences and more amount of humor but I believe that reading English versions will not give any inconvenience.

I wish that every student taking the course enjoys the course and the articles.
