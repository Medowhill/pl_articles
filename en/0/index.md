## How to Read the Materials

One article does not always correspond to one lecture of the course. Some articles deal with essential topics whom lectures do not cover. Two or more articles can target the contents of a single lecture, and a single article can explain concepts from multiple lectures. Therefore, this section gives brief guidelines on reading the materials.

Suppose that the current article is the zeroth article.

* 'Programming Languages' introduces what the field of programming languages is.

I recommend students to read the first article right after the first lecture.

* 'Introduction to Scala' introduces Scala, a language used in the course.

I recommend students to read the second article before starting the first coding assignment. Anyone who has already experienced Scala can skip the article.

* 'Introduction to Functional Programming' deals with immutability, recursion, and lists.
* 'First-Class Functions' deals with first-class function and options.
* 'Working with Scala Collections' deals with the Scala standard library and `for` expressions.
* 'Pattern Matching' discusses the necessity of pattern matching and shows various use cases of pattern matching.

The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth articles introduce functional programming. Functional programming is not the main topic of the course. However, every code of the course is written functionally, and to understand functional programming is crucial to understand concepts covered by the course. The first coding assignment does not require every detail of the articles, but, afterward, they are essential to take lectures and to do assignments. Thus, I highly recommend students to read the articles in the first month. Those who are familiar with functional programming can skip all of them.

* 'Syntax' explains what the syntax of a language is and defines the syntax of AE.
* 'Semantics' explains what the semantics of a language is and defines the semantics of AE.
* 'Identifiers' introduces identifiers and defines WAE.
* 'First-Order Functions' introduces first-order functions and defines F1WAE.
* 'Closures' introduces first-class functions and closures and defines FAE.
* 'Lambda Calculus' deals with lambda calculus and Church encoding.
* 'Recursion' introduces recursive functions and defines RCFAE.

The seventh article and the later are complementary to the lectures of the course. I recommend students to read the articles after lectures corresponding to the articles: read 'Syntax' and 'Semantics' after the 'Syntax and Semantics' lecture; read 'Identifiers' after the 'Evaluation of WAE' lecture; read 'First-Order Functions' after the 'First-Order Functions' lecture; read 'Closures' and 'Lambda Calculus' after the 'Functions' lecture; read 'Recursion' after the 'Implementing Recursion' lecture.

During the semester, I will add missing articles and edit the preface accordingly.

Articles other than the reading materials are the reviews of conferences and papers related to programming languages. They are for people interested in programming languages but not for every student taking the course. A few articles exist at this moment, and I will add new reviews slowly but steadily.

Every reader can give comments on all the articles. Please write any questions or opinions in comments. I will answer them and reflect them in the articles as soon as possible. Both Korean and English are allowable for comments, but other languages are not. One can use a nickname instead of one's real name, but please do not impersonate others and use a single consistent name for the ease of conversations. The email field is optional. If an email address is given, it is used for sending notification of a response to the comment and unavailable for any others. Comments are neither editable nor deletable. Hence, please double-check before submitting comments.

## Why I Write Articles

I like programming languages (PL) and to explain things I know. It is the first reason to decide to write articles about PL. However, to choose the topic of an article is not completely easy at the beginning. Various subjects exist in PL.

I think that writing reading materials for the *programming languages* course of KAIST can be a nice starting point. It gives me the motivation to keep writing articles rather than giving up on someday since many reviews of the course in [OTL](https://otl.kaist.ac.kr/review/result/course/749/2/) are claiming that the course is difficult to study due to the lack of supplementary materials. Lecture slides used in the course target materials for lectures with oral explanations but not for self-study. Besides, because PL is not as popular as some other fields like machine learning, online materials for undergraduate-level students are rare. Despite great lectures by professor Ryu, the reasons make many students feel difficulties to follow the content of the course when they are not able to understand the whole lectures. I hope that my articles can help students taking the course.

At the first place, I considered writing in only Korean since Korean articles treating PL topics can hardly be found while there are ones in English. However, to use the articles as the official reading materials of the course, writing in English as well as Korean is necessary. The course is given in English and students who are more familiar with English than Korean also takes the course. Therefore, I am planning to write both in Korean and English even though the decision makes the load become twice.

For fairness, I will try hard to include the same amount of technical detail in articles written in the respective languages. Korean versions might contain a larger number of kind sentences and more amount of humor but I believe that reading English versions will not give any inconvenience.

I wish that every student taking the course enjoys the course and the articles.

## Acknowledgments

I thank professor Ryu for giving feedback on the article. I also thank students who wrote reviews of the course in OTL.
